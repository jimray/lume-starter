# Lume starter

This is a basic site package for building static websites with [Lume](https://lume.land).

By default, it has the barest of of configuration. [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev) is used to bundle and minify to a single CSS file from partials, but does no real post-processing.

All source files are located in the `src` directory.

Layouts, templates, and CSS partials are in the `src/_includes` directory.

Static assets (images, fonts, javascript) are located in `src/assets`. If I get fancy with the JavaScript at any point, I'll figure out the proper toolchain.
